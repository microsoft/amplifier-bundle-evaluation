"""Tools the grader session calls to submit its rubric verdict.

The grader has two phases per evaluation. Phase 1 is free-text exploration
ending in an "initial report" as the assistant's final message. Phase 2 calls
`submit_rubric` with the scored rubric. If validation fails, a follow-up
message asks for fixes (up to 2 retries).
